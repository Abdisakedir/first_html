                the difference beetwen html and xhtml
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating web pages.
The main difference between the two is that HTML has a looser syntax, while XHTML has stricter rules that conform to XML standards.
HTML has gone through many versions since its inception in the early 1990s.

Some of the most notable versions include:
1.
HTML 2.0: This version was released in 1995 and introduced basic table layouts and form elements.
2.
HTML 3.0: Released in 1997, this version included support for style sheets and tables with expanded functionality.
3.
HTML 4.01: This version was released in 1999 and included support for frames, scripting, internationalization, and improved accessibility features.
4.
XHTML 1.0: This version was released in 2000 and was designed to bring HTML into compliance with XML standards.
It required stricter syntax and introduced new elements such as the <div> and <span> tags.
5.
HTML5: This is the current version of HTML and was released in 2014.
It introduces several new features such as multimedia support, new form elements, and advanced layout options.
Each version of HTML has introduced new elements and functionality, making web development more accessible and efficient.
However, it's important to keep up with the latest versions and standards to ensure that your web pages are optimized for performance, security, and compatibility.
